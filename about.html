        <h2>Who was Thucydides?</h2>
        <img style="width: 80%; padding-left: 20%; border-radius: 8px;" src="images/thucydides-pic.jpg" alt="picture of thucydides">
        <p><b>Thucydides</b> (c. 460 - 400 BC) was an Athenian historian and general.</p>
        <p>
            Thucydides is often referred to as the "father of scientific history" for the metholodogy found in his most
            famous work, the <i>History of the Peloponnesian War</i>. According to his own account, he was born in Athens to a
            family
            with blood and business ties to Thrace.
            Due to this connection, Thucydides was sent as a general to Macedonia—a region close to Thrace—in 424 BC, where he
            would defend the city of Amphipolis from the Spartans.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city eventually fell, and for his failure he was exiled from Athens.
            He used his exile as an opportunity to travel around the Spartan-aligned states, giving him the chance to record
            the conflict from both the Athenian and Spartan perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>He pioneered critical elements of historiography, including:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 5%;">
            <li>Strict chronological organization</li>
            <li>Extensive use of primary sources</li>
            <li>Neutrality in accounts</li>
            <li>Disregard of the supernatural in accounts</li>
            <li>Rationalization and historicization of mythology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This is in stark contrast to his contemporaries who often included the supernatural or popular mythology in
            their work.
        </p>

        <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Thucydides' philosophy remains vital today as the foundation of strategy, geopolitics, and international relations, and is
            thus critical to understand for anyone going into similar fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Such analysis is doubly important during times of increasing geopolitical complexity and conflict, such as
            the one we find ourselves in today.
        </p>
